DOCS / TODO / FIXME 

* the plan was to have one unified agreement template file, as differences between them are negligible or non existant apart from options iirc

* this unified template file should be ready and should look better than before, though always good to check.

* Introduced code to display FLA at the end, which should work and a toggle button at the front which should disable some stuff/choose some default options and maybe change thins at the end. The Button is there, but is not fully functional if I remember correctly

* at some point, also to accompany new look an update to bootstrap3 would be nice, but this breaks things
